### Acknowledgements
  We would like to thank the following resources for help and inspiration.
  Help From Preceptors: Courtney, Soulai,

### Limitations
The fundamental design limitations may include, no-pause feature after a life is lost, too many lasers on the canvas at the one time can
lead to lagging in the game-play processing. This is a result from a dense and complicated canvas.animate method which consists of multiple if statements and loops.
Possible lagging may occur during game-play every few seconds or so.

### Societal Impact
Our project aims to be inclusive, diversity, accesible to the majority of populations. 
The game includes the following limitations in accesibility:
  - A blind person would not be able to control the spaceship or complete the missoin due to the lack of visual aspects to play the game. 
  - Players of younger age or those who lack hand-eye coordination may find it more difficult to play and complete the mission
  - A person who uses an assistive device or has physical disabilities may also find it quite difficult to play the game.

 An unintended consequence of our software is that it may promote aggressive gameplay and behaviors. 
 We do not foresee our program being used in an oppressive situation but they may exist:
 One possible situation of the program being used in a malicious way, is it could be recreated and used to scam people out of money if the game were monitized.
