Description:
Defend the solar system from an additional Sun by shooting it down, in this arcade-style game.  
The shooting game is controlled by the player and consists of a spaceship who's goal is to shoot lasers at the sun until it is shrunk into non-existence. The spaceship executes lasers once the WASD keys are clicked, the spacebar is pressed, or with a mouse click. Once the laser is shot, it can colldie against the other planets, and the laser will bounce off of it and have the ability to damage the spaceship's lives.

Acknowledgements
  We would like to thank the following resources for help and inspiration.
  Help From Preceptors: Courtney, Soulai,

Limitations 
The fundamental design limitations may include, no-pause feature after a life is lost, laser may stay on the canvas for an extended amount of time, 
leading to lagging in the game-play processing. This is a result from a dense and complicated canvas.animate method which consists of multiple if statements and loops.
Possible lagging may occur during game-play every few seconds or so.

Societal Impact
Our project aims to be inclusive, diversity, accesible to the majority of populations. 
The code may include the following limitation in accesibility:
A blind person would not be able to control the spaceship or be able to have a playthrough of the game as the only objects that make a sound effect are the lasers when they are created and shot up. An unintended consequence of our software being using an a malicious way is to disregard ?.
